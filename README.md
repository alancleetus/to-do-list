# to-do-list
First android application.  To do list application that is simple to use


This is a very simple to do list android application.  
Reasons for doig this project:
1. I wanted a simple list of things i needed to remeber.  
2. Most apps in the app store have too many complicated functionalities like (time, date, how many time to remind me in a week,...)
3. The UI in play store apps were not what I was looking for (also most of them have ads).
4. LEARN about android development. 

Usage:
This app is very simple to use.  
1. enter the to do list item in the input field at the top of the app.
2. press enter or the add button to add it to the list of items to to do.
3. click on any item in the to do section of the app to move it to the done section.
4. if you miss click, then press on the item in the done section to undo the action.
5. if you want to delete an item, then first move it to the done section, then long press the item in the done section.

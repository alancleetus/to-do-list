First android application.  To do list application that is simple to use.


This is a very simple to do list android application.  
Reasons for doing this project:
1. I wanted a simple list of things I needed to remeber.  
2. Most apps in the app store have too many complicated functionalities like (time, date, how many time to remind me in a week,...)
3. The UI for pre-existing to do list apps were not what I was looking for (also most of them have ads).
4. LEARN about android development. 

Usage:
This app is very simple to use.  
1. Click on the button in the bottom right of the app to add a new task.
2. Click on the green tick to mark done.
3. Click on the red cross in the Done section to Delete item.
4. Click on any item in the Done section to move it back to the not done section.
5. Long press on any task to edit the task text and type.
